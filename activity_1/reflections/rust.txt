this kinda does more than just threads counting but barely. 
There is an additional thread receiving messages from each thread. This is optional, i could've used println, but it seemed interesting.
I also factored out thread creation for some reason.
It's so syntactically dense yet also so much text.

unwrap() is weird
they are like Java Optionals but youre forced to use them for safety
Results are like, what you asked for, along with maybe an error message, and maybe its just None
threads use them a lot, making this more gross than a normal rust program

it means you can pass a Result around for as long as you want before dealing with any errors? im sure it lets you do other things. but there are cases where a Result is 100% guaranteed to be the value you expect, so many unwrap()s are useless
it kinda is. youre given a couple useful ones so its not as http'y, like unwrap_or(func) so itll execute func if anything other than an OK is received
